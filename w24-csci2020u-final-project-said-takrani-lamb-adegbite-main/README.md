### Project Information
This project involves developing a To-Do list application. The server interacts with the client which uses mostly HTML/JS for the user interface. It will support login, task creation with names and due dates, and priority levels to indicate whether a task is a high, medium, or low priority. There are also categories under which tasks can be categorized.
